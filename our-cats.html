      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>white cotton mouse with black whiskers</li>
        <li>green corduroy mouse missing eyes</li>
        <li>red mouse that is missing a tail</li>
        <li>blue mouse that is too depressing to play with</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Scout has only one toy. He's particular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a wadded up piece of paper</li>

      <p>
      They don't really have friends but they do watch the birds at
      the birdfeeder. They like the fat ones.
